# nysolar_applications

Project start date: 1/3/22

The data are drawn from NY Solar program using the Socrata API. And are based on project incentive applications submitted by contractors to NYSUN. I note that there are data quality concerns due to improper and/or incomplete responses from project contractors. These include errors in reported geographic coordinates for project location. 

The primary objective of this work is to:

* predict project costs for residential, small commercial, and megawatt (community solar) program projects in relation to materials, geography, time, and contractor covariates.

* identify potential project subcategories that may be relevant to incentive designs and/or energy equity under NY's clean energy program(s). 

* explore spatial components of project deployment
